Hello, my name is Draven Grondona and I'm a Computer Science student at UC Merced. I am interested in Cybersecurity and love to learn all things Computer Science. I have experience in Python, C++, and System Administration through courses I've taken. I'm eager to continue learning and building my experience in programming and system administration. I've worked on a few projects already including a Python game inspired by Flappy Bird and a Minecraft server that I run from home using Ubuntu. This has made me familiar with the Linux CLI.
